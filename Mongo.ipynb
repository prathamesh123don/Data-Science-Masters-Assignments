    "##### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> MongoDb is a document oriented NoSQL database. These are the database that do not follow the traditional relational database model. Instead they store data in different ways, such as in documents key value pairs or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It stores the data in documents , which are JSON like objects. This makes it easy to store query data that is not well suited for a relational database, such as semi-structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benifits are\n",
    "1. Flexibility.\n",
    "2. Scalability.\n",
    "3. Performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenarios where it is prefered to use MongoDB over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Storing semi-structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "2. Highly scalabe.\n",
    "3. Develop applications quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not supports advance features such as joins and subqueries. \n",

    "#####  Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> 1. Document model: JSON like objects\n",
    "2. Schemaless: It does not require a schema, which mwans that you can add new fields to documents or change the structure documents without having to modify the databse schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible quering: Variety of querying options.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing, which allows you to speed up queries by creating indexes on specific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Aggregations: MongoDB supports aggregations, which allow you to perform complex queries on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Security: MongoDB supports a variety of security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Tools: MongoDB comes with a number of tools that make it easy to manage your database, including the MongoDB shell, the MongoDB Compass GUI, and the MongoDB Atlas cloud service.\n",
